## Chino.Explorer

a simple data explorer for [Chino](https://www.chino.io) Repositories

In the first steps it allows you to view your Documents, Users and Collections.

### The Schema view.
Here you may insert, edit or delete the data stored in a document.

### The User view
In the user part of the tree, the existing users are grouped by their UserSchema.
You have the possibility to create, edit or delete a user, including the properties as defined in the UserSchema.

### The Collections
The Collection-View is currently kind of WIP, because even Chino is currently restructuring the way collections work.
